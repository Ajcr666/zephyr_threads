create a mutex "mutex" and a condition variable "cond"
create thread1 and thread2
thread1 function:
     -lock mutex

     -signal the condition variable "cond"
     -unlock mutex
     -sleep for 1 second
     -repeat
thread2 function:
    -lock mutex
    -wait for the signal from the condition variable "cond"
    -print "thread2"
    -unlock mutex
    -repeat
in the main function:
    -initialize mutex and condition variable
    -create thread1 and thread2
    -join thread1 and thread2
